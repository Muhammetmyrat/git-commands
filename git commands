git commands

Using git switch (Recommended for newer Git versions)

Switch to an existing branch:
git switch branch-name

Switch to a new branch and create it if it doesn't exist:
git switch -c new-branch-name

Stash the changes:
git stash

git switch branch-name  # or git checkout branch-name

Apply the stashed changes (when needed):
git stash apply

Force Delete (regardless of merge status)
git branch -D branch_name

Delete a Local Branch
Safe Delete (only if the branch has been merged)
git branch -d branch_name

Delete the branch:

For local: git branch -D branch_name
For remote: git push origin --delete branch_name

Fetch the Latest Changes
First, fetch the latest changes from the remote repository to update your local copy with the new branch information.
git fetch origin

Verify the Branch
Ensure you are now on the correct branch and that it is tracking the remote branch.
git branch -vv

Unstage a File
If youâ€™ve added a file to the staging area using git add, and you want to unstage it, you can use the following command:
git restore --staged <file_name>

Rename the branch locally:
git branch -m new-branch-name

Push the renamed branch to the remote repository:
git push origin -u new-branch-name
